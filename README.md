## Architecture

### Routing

- `/single/:id/:token` - Authenticated single chart view with full analytics
- `*` (catch-all) - Public chart view via address resolution

### Data Flow

1. Initial data fetch from `https://api.onchainrank.com/startup/${id}/${token}`
2. WebSocket connection to `https://ws.onchainrank.com`
3. Subscribe to chart-specific room for real-time updates
4. Merge incoming candle data with existing data
5. Auto-update all indicators and metrics

### API Endpoints

- `GET https://profile.onchainrank.com/marketing-addr/` - Address to ID resolution
- `GET https://api.onchainrank.com/startup/${id}/${token}` - Initial chart data
- `DELETE https://api.onchainrank.com/delete/${id}` - Chart deletion
- `WS https://ws.onchainrank.com` - Real-time updates via Socket.IO

### State Management

- React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local component state
- localStorage for persistent indicator visibility preferences
- WebSocket subscriptions managed in useEffect cleanup functions
- Chart instance management via useRef

## Key Components

- **App.js**: Main router and application entry point
- **SingleChartPage.js**: Authenticated chart page with full analytics
- **DecorChart.js**: Public chart page with address-based access
